<h1>What is Hack@UWT?</h1>
<h2>Hack@UWT is a Hackathon!</h2>
<p class="longtext">
    A hackathon is an event where developers, artists, designers and computer amateurs meet
    and work on developing solutions to real-world problems. Hackathons blend techniques such as
    brainstorming, prototyping and open source designs and have become popular events for facilitating
    technological innovation in recent years. Hack@UWT is an event that will promote innovation and
    provide a creative atmosphere for those who are passionate about designing and building prototypes.
